Doge-UI - Only HTML and CSS 

Anyone is welcome to Contribute to this project. Let's make it big :).

The project is in very initial project, and I am working very hard to make it better.

This is a CSS framework that is very simple and easy to use.

I will make a webpage using these componenets and users can determine what they need to use in their websites.

After that, Users can open the HTML text file of components, and select the code of the componenet they need. Users also need to select the corresponding CSS code as well and place it into their stylesheet.




Like other CSS frameworks which have a very nice looking website with tutorials and everything, I am also working on the website of this project as well.
